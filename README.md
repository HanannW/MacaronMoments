HTML/CSS - Bootstrap Practice

This project was made for me to practice my HTML and CSS in more details whilst incoporated the bootsrap framework. 
There is also a small addition of javascript , however did not require additional page and instead added it as a cript at th ebottom of my HTML page.

For this project I have also decided to add a lot more comments, to explain to myself (when revisit) what some sections of the code is for aswell as to highlight some important sections.

feedback is welcome :)
