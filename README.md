HTML/CSS - Bootstrap Practice

This project was made to practice HTML and CSS in more detail whilst incoporating the bootstrap framework. 
There is also a small addition of javascript , however did not require additional page and instead added it as a script tag at the bottom of my HTML page.

For this project I have also decided to add a lot more comments, to explain to myself (when revisiting) what some sections of the code is for aswell as to highlight some important sections.

feedback is always welcome :)
